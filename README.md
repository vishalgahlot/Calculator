# Calculator
Calculator in java with JFrame
In this we use Iframe for making layout that is UI
n use some basic  coding to implement it.

Here we compile the java file in cmd of windows 
go to the directory where your file is saved use this cmd in command prompt::--- cd directory

1) javac filename.java
2) java mainclassname

Always remember you can put different filename n mainclass name but u've to aware in above steps that what the name you have put in class n filename.

After that we made the jar file by using cmd:----> jar cfm filename.jar manifest.txt filename.class



Download the jar file :----> http://www.mediafire.com/download/g3x45mwdd2ldk44/Calc.jar
